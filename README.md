Welcome to the take-home assignment.

In this assignment, you will be building a chrome extension that takes your resume and whenever the user is on a job application page, it understands the requirements for the job and gives suggestions on the resume using OpenAI. This assignment aims to give you hands-on experience in building a chrome extension that leverages the power of OpenAI to provide personalized recommendations.

Overview
Your task is to build a chrome extension that takes the user's resume as input and provides personalized suggestions for improving the resume based on the job requirements. The extension should work in the following way:

Whenever the user is on a job application page, the extension should be able to extract the job requirements from the page. You can use any method you deem fit, including scraping the page or using an API.

Once the job requirements are extracted, the extension should be able to compare them with the user's resume and identify areas where the user's skills and experience match or don't match the job requirements.

Based on the comparison, the extension should provide personalized suggestions for improving the user's resume. You should use OpenAI's API for this, and you can choose the specific model and endpoint based on your research and experimentation.

The suggestions the extension provides should be displayed in real-time as the user edits their resume. This means that the extension should be able to detect when the user is editing their resume and update the suggestions accordingly.

Requirements
The extension should be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can use any front-end frameworks or libraries you like, but the final product should be a Chrome extension.

The extension should use OpenAI's API to generate personalized suggestions for the user's resume.

The extension should be able to extract job requirements from job application pages. You can use any method you like for this, including scraping or using an API.

The extension should be able to compare the job requirements with the user's resume and provide personalized suggestions in real time.

Bonus Points

Implement a feature that allows the user to customize the suggestions the extension provides.

Implement a feature allowing users to import their resume from popular job sites like LinkedIn or Indeed.

Submission Guidelines
Your solution should be submitted as a ZIP file containing the source code, documentation, and any necessary instructions for installing and using the extension.

You should also include a README file that explains how to use the extension and any additional features you have implemented.

Your code should be well-organized, well-documented, and easy to understand.

Evaluation Criteria
Functionality: Does the extension meet the requirements outlined above? Does it work as expected?

Code quality: Is the code well-organized, well-documented, and easy to understand?

User experience: Is the extension easy to use and understand? Does it provide clear and useful feedback to the user?
